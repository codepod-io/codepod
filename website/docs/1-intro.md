# Introduction

[CodePod.io](http://CodePod.io) is an open-source canvas-based coding IDE that
helps programmers develop large, production-ready projects faster by presenting
interactive coding (e.g., Jupyter) on a hierarchical, scoped, 2D canvas. Without
code modularization (traditionally done via organizing text files under
tree-structured folder hierarchies), a Jupyter notebook can easily become messy,
difficult to manage and scale. Alleviating such limitations, CodePod was born to
bump interactive coding beyond prototyping and demos. Our website is
