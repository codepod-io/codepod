# CodePod: coding on a canvas, organized.

Codepod provides the interactive coding experience popularized by Jupyter, but
with scalability and production-readiness. Users can still incrementally build
up code by trying out a small code snippet each time. But they would not be
overwhelmed by the great number of code snippets as the projects grow.
