# CodePod: coding on a canvas, organized.

Codepod provides the interactive coding experience popularized by Jupyter, but
with scalability and production-readiness. Users can still incrementally build
up code by trying out a small code snippet each time. But they would not be
overwhelmed by the great number of code snippets as the projects grow. Learn
more on our website at https://codepod.io.

# Install

You can [use CodePod online](https://app.codepod.io) without installing it
locally. To install it on your computer:

Step 1: install prerequisite: [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download) runtime
and python & ipykernel:

```
brew install node # example for MacOS
pip3 install ipykernel
```

Step 2: Install codepod CLI app from [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/codepod):

```
> npm install -g codepod
> codepod --version
# 0.0.7
```

Step 3: launch CodePod from terminal:

```
> codepod /path/to/local/repo
# ... ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4001
```

Open this URL in your browser to see the app. The files will be saved to the
directory `/path/to/repo/codepod.bin|json`. The `codepod.bin` is the source of
truth, and `codepod.json` is for human-readability only.

In the future, you can update the app:

```
> npm update -g codepod
```

# Develop

Open two terminals. On one:

```
cd apps/api
pnpm dev
```

On the other:

```
cd apps/ui
pnpm dev
```

Now go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app.
